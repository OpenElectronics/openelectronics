== Introduction

Welcome to the Open Electronics book.  It is no coincidence that the title of this book connotes a spirit of openness and sharing reminiscent of open-source software.  This is an open-source book, and unlike many existing electronics textbooks, this one is available for free.  More importantly, you are free (and encouraged!) to contribute to it.
